<h2>About</h2>
<p>
ZyTrax is an easy to use music sequencer with an interface heavily inspired
by 90's "tracker" software (most specifically <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_Tracker"> Impulse Tracker</a>).
</p>
<p>
While contemporary software that uses this approach exists, it usually has a 
high entry barrier because it maintains compatibility with old formats.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to this, ZyTrax starts afresh with an user friendly approach (no hex
numbers, pure plugin-based architecture, inlined automation envelopes, smart
automations, zoomable patterns and a simple pattern/orderlist layout).
</p>

<h2>Modernizing a great paradigm</h2>
<p>
The approach for creating music with ZyTrax is completely different to standard
sequenceers, which are heavily mouse-oriented and/or requiere significant
peformance skills to enter notes with a MIDI keyboard.
</p>
<p>
ZyTrax brings back to life the forgotten arts of pattern-based sequencing, 
reimagined for the modern times. With it, composers can write music at high 
throughput compared to conventional means. This is achieved by presenting 
a simple and clean user interface that is heavily <i>PC-Keyboard oriented</i>.
</p>
<p>
If you have never used a sequencer, ZyTrax can be a great
starting point. Otherwise, it can be an excellent alternative to craft your music.
</p>
<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
<p>
At the time of this writing ZyTrax only runs on Windows and Linux/X11 and supports 64 bits
VST2 plugins. It should compile on MacOS (it uses GTK), but no
plugin support exists at the moment for that  platforms.
</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
