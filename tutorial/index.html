<a name="setting_up"><h2>Setting Up</h2></a>
<p>
Before doing anything, you will need to find plugins. Open the
<i>Settings</i> windows by going <b>Settings -> Preferences</b>.
</p>
<img src="plugins.png">
<p>
Enter paths where plugins will be scanned (just click <i>Browse</i> to open
a dialog for selecting a path). When enough paths are there, push the
<i>Scan</i> button. 
</p>
<p>
This will scan all plugins available in the folders entered. If you add or
remove plugins, you will need to hit <i>Scan</i> again. This happens
because scanning is a time consuming operation, so ZyTrax will cache the
plugins found for you.
</p>
<a name="track"><h2>Adding a Track</h2></a>
<p>
Use the <i>+New Track</i> button to create a new track. Both the track and
the corresponding rack and volume controls will appear:
</p>
<img src="new_track.png">
<p>
By default, the track will be silent. Noise can be made by adding
<i>Effects</i> to it. To do this, press the <b>Insert FX</b> label at the
bottom, on the rack section. This will open a menu where you can select 
the scanned plugins.
</p>
<p> The effect added should now appear on the rack. Make sure to select a
synth, or else no sound generation will happen.
</p>
<img src="add_fx.png">
<a name="inserting"><h2>Inserting Values</h2></a>
<p>
Make sure to focus on the <i>Pattern Editor</i>. Either click on it (the
column full of dots on the left), or press <b>F2</b>, which will
automatically focus on it (remember this key binding for future use, it's
very handy!)
</p>
<p>
The first thing that you will notice is that the cursor can move around
as if it was in a text document. Horizontally, for a pattern track, 
the cursor can move within different fields. Each field is as follows:
</p>
<h3>Note Field</h3>
<img src="note_field.png">
<p>
The note field is used for entering notes. When the cursor is in this field,
your PC keyboard becomes a two-octave musical keyboard with lots of useful
functions:
</p>
<img src="keyboard.png">
<p>
Most keys become a virtual piano you can use to enter notes (And note-off:
"==="). After a while entering your input with the keyboard, you will be
surprised of how productive you have become.
</p>
<img src="insert.gif">
<h3>Octave Field</h3>
<img src="octave_field.png">
<p>
This fields only allows entering the octave as a number.
</p>
<h3>Volume Field</h3>
<img src="volume_field.png">
<p>
Finally, the volume field. When unentered, volume is assumed to be the
maximum volume (99). Volumes from 00 to 99 can be input for each note.
</p>
<p>
Volumes can also be input without a note (which will send MIDI note
pressure to plugins that support it), and into <i>Note Off</i> events, 
for synthesizers that support note off velocity.
</p>
<a name="editing"><h2>Editing</h2></a>
<p>
Together with field input are three keys designed to make input easier:
<p>
<h3>Insert/Delete</h3>
<p>Pressing the <i>Insert</i> or <i>Delete</i> keys will literally insert or delete rows
below the cursor. These are very handy when you want to move notes around
after they were inserted:
</p>
<img src="insert_delete.gif">
<h3>Field Clear</h3>
The <i>Field Clear</i> key will move the cursor down while clearing anything
on the way. It's useful to just erase notes:
</p>
<img src="field_clear.gif">
<p>
When positioned in the volume field, it will just clear the volume.
</p>
<h2>Navigating</h2>
<p>
So far everything has been shown with a single track (that has only one
column), but reality is that songs can quickly grow to have multiple
columns and tracks. For this, some useful keybindings exist:
</p>
<h3>Tabbing</h3>
<p>
Using <i>Tab</i> and <i>Shift-Tab</i> will allow to quickly cycle between columns,
skipping the fields entirely. This is the most common way of moving
around horizontally:
</p>
<img src="tabbing.gif">
<h3>Page Up/Down</h3>
<p>
To move up and down by a <i>bar</i>, use the <i>Page Up</i> and <i>Page
Down</i> keys. This helps a lot when navigating long patterns.
</p>
<img src="page_up_down.gif">
<h3>Home/End</h3>
<p>
The <i>Home</i> and <i>End</i> keys are vital for navigation. They move to
the next and previous <i>boundaries</i>. 
</p>
<p>
When pressing <i>Home</i>, if the cursor is currently in a field, it will move to the beginning of the
column. If already there, it will move to the beginning of the track.
</p>
<p>
If the cursor is already at the beginning of the track, it will move to the
beginning of the first track and, from there, to the first row:
</p>
<img src="home.gif">
<p>The <i>End</i> key does similarly in the opposite direction, going to the
next column, the last column and the the last row.
</p>
<img src="end.gif">
<a name="selection"><h2>Selection</h2></a>
<p>
Part of what makes keyboard-based input so efficient is being able to
precisely manage selected regions and interact with them.
</p>
<p>ZyTrax has many ways to create a selection. Dragging with the mouse
across the fields works, as well as using shift-cursors.
</p>
<h3>Block Begin/End</h3>
<p>
Most of the time, however, the most efficient way is to use the block selection
keybindings. The basic ones are <i>Alt-B</i> for <i>Block Begin</i> and
<i>Alt-E</i> for <i>Block End</i>.
</p>
<img src="block_selection.gif">
<h3>Select Column/Track/All</h3>
<p>
It is possible to alternate the selection between the current column,
track and entire song by pressing <i>Alt-L</i> repeatedly.
</p>
<img src="column_select.gif">
<p>Combining
this keybinding with the previously mentioned block selection keys allows
to quickly produce complex selections with a few keypresses.
</p>
<img src="block_column_select.gif">
<p>To get rid of the selection, simply press <i>Alt-U</i>.
<h2>Clipboard</h2>
<p>
Once the selection is laid out properly, many useful clipboard operations are provided.
Press <i>Alt-C</i> to copy the selection to the clipboard, or <i>Alt-Z</i> to cut it (zap 
and copy).
</p>
<a name="pasting"><h3>Pasting</h3></a>
<p>
There are three different paste modes, depending on what you want to do:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Paste-Overwrite: <i>Alt-O</i>.</li>
<li>Paste-Insert: <i>Alt-P</i>.</li>
<li>Paste-Mix: <i>Alt-M</i>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Paste Overwrite</h3>
<p>
It simply pastes starting from the cursor, replacing the contents of the events with the contents
of the selection.
</p>
<h3>Paste Insert</h3>
<p>
It pastes, but pushes the events in the columns being pasted downwards. This is very useful when you
want to do repeating "patterns" like beats, or anything that repeats.
</p>
<img src="paste_insert.gif">
<h3>Paste Mix</h3>
<p>
Works similar to <i>overwrite</i> but does not erase the previous contents. In fact, if there is any content it will
be respected.
</p>
<a name="operations"><h2>Selection Operations</h2></a>
<p>
Once a selection block is laid out, it is possible to do a number of useful operations on it. Check the <i>Selection</i>
menu on top, and make sure to learn the many shortcuts, as they are very useful:
</p>
<img src="selection_menu.png">
<a name="automations"><h2>Automations</h2></a>
<p>Plugin effects will usually provide a list of automatable parameters. They appear as checkboxes on the left side of the window:
</p>
<img src="automation.png">
<p>
Enabling one of those checkboxes will automatically make an automation column appear:
</p>
<img src="automation2.png">
<p>
Numbers can be written from 0 to 99 to control the exposed parameters, these numbers are <i>discrete</i>, which means that the
value changes only when a new value is found, and effect takes place immediately. You can interpolate them with the <i>Alt-K</i>
effect if you wish (still discrete, but you can make a nice ramp).
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it may be desired to have more fine-grained control of the exposed parameter over time. This is possible by modifying
the visualization mode. Simply right-click over the automation column and this menu will appear:
</p>
<img src="automation3.png">
<p>
Selecting the envelope views, the automation can be edited visually over time (and this time, it does interpolate the values):
</p>
<img src="automation4.png">
<a name="commands"><h2>Commands</h2></a>
<p>
Commands are an alternative way to modify plugin effect parameters. Instead of ticking the <i>automation</i> box, just select
a letter in the parameter list:
</p>
<img src="command.png">
<p>
Immediately, nothing will happen in the pattern view. Right click over the note columns in a pattern to open the settings:
of that track:
</p>
<img src="command2.png">
<p>
This will make a command column appear. These columns are different from note columns, as they take a letter and a value (00-99 as always).
</p>
<p>
In there, just use the same leter you assigned in the effect to control the parameter. This allows controlling a large amount of parameters
from a single column:
</p>
<img src="command3.png">
<p>
As this doing this all the time for all effects can be tedious, it is possible to make this letter the default for this specific effect,
so next time you instantiate it it will remember it. To do this, just right click over the parameter name:
</p>
<img src="command4.png">
<p>If you want to edit this (or remove it), you can find all these assignments in the <i>settings</i> window:</p>
<img src="command5.png">
<a name="midi"><h2>MIDI</h2></a>
<p>
ZyTrax supports MIDI-In. The usage is very limited though, as it will only play notes from the track selected (the track is selected automatically
when you open an effect Window). This can allow you to try out ideas, patches and notes on the plugin window or pattern editor.
