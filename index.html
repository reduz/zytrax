<h2>About</h2>
<p>
ZyTrax is an easy to use music sequencer with an interface heavily inspired
by 90's "tracker" software (most specifically <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_Tracker"> Impulse Tracker</a>).
</p>
<p>
While contemporary software that uses this approach exists, it usually has a 
high entry barrier because it maintains compatibility with old formats.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to this, ZyTrax starts afresh with an user friendly approach (no hex
numbers, pure plugin-based architecture, inlined automation envelopes, smart
automations, zoomable patterns and a simple pattern/orderlist layout).
</p>

<h2>Modernizing a great paradigm</h2>
<p>
The approach for creating music with ZyTrax is completely different to standard
sequenceers, which are heavily mouse-oriented and/or requiere significant
peformance skills to enter notes with a MIDI keyboard.
</p>
<p>
ZyTrax brings back to life the forgotten arts of pattern-based sequencing, 
reimagined for the modern times. With it, composers can write music at high 
throughput compared to conventional means. This is achieved by presenting 
a simple and clean user interface that is heavily <i>PC-Keyboard oriented</i>.
</p>
<p>
If you have never used a sequencer, ZyTrax can be a great
starting point. Otherwise, it can be an excellent alternative to craft your music.
</p>
<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
<p>
At the time of this writing ZyTrax only runs on Windows and supports 64 bits
VST2 plugins. It should compile on X11 and MacOS (it uses GTK), but no
plugin support exists at the moment for these platforms.
</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
